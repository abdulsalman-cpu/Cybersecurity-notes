# ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

## What is ARP?
ARP is used to map an IP address (logical) to a MAC address (physical) within a local network.

Simple:
ARP asks "Who has this IP?" and gets the MAC address.

## Why ARP is Needed

- Devices communicate using IP addresses
- Actual data delivery happens using MAC addresses
- ARP converts IP to MAC

---

## How ARP Works

### 1. ARP Request (Broadcast)
- Sent to all devices in the network
- Message:
  "Who has this IP address?"

### 2. ARP Reply (Unicast)
- Only the correct device responds
- Message:
  "This is my MAC address"

### 3. ARP Cache (Storage)
- Device saves IP and MAC mapping
- Makes future communication faster

## ARP Cache

A small table that stores:
- IP Address
- MAC Address

This helps avoid sending repeated ARP requests.

## Key Terms

IP Address:
Logical address used to identify a device

MAC Address:
Physical hardware address of a device

ARP Request:
A message asking for the MAC address

ARP Reply:
A message providing the MAC address

## Memory Trick

IP = Name  
MAC = Real Identity  
ARP = Translator
